The following code corresponds to the FASTQ files generated by PCR amplification of CPtracer sequences and subsequent single-end 300 bp sequencing. Please change the working directory to the folder containing your FASTQ files before running the code. In addition, replace the "pre-fix" file name with the file name of your own data.By executing CPtracer-extraction-1, CPtracer-extraction-2, and CPtracer-extraction-3 sequentially, all data will be integrated, and a consolidated csv file will be generated.
Prior to running the extraction pipeline, fastx-toolkit, seqkit(Shen, W., Le, S., Li, Y., and Hu, F. (2016). SeqKit: A Cross-Platform and Ultrafast Toolkit for FASTA/Q File Manipulation.
