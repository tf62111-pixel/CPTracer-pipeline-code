The following code corresponds to the FASTQ files generated by PCR amplification of CPtracer sequences and subsequent single-end 300 bp sequencing. Please change the working directory to the folder containing your FASTQ files before running the code. In addition, replace the "pre-fix" file name with the file name of your own data.By executing CPtracer-extraction-1, CPtracer-extraction-2, and CPtracer-extraction-3 sequentially, all data will be integrated, and a consolidated Excel file will be generated.
